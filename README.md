# Subnautica Mods
## Scanner Room Control Chip
WARNING! Will not work in Living Large Update! Please use Legacy branch.
Playing subnautika, I found myself in such a situation. I needed to select another resource in the scanning room, but I was quite far from it. Sounds familiar? Say no more!
Using this chip you can select another resource and turn your scanner room on/off from anywhere! It only works with 16 scanner rooms per world, but why on earth would anyone need more than 16 rooms?
